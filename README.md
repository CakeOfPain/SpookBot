Discord Bot built with JDA 5 ([Java Discord API](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA "GitHub Page of JDA")), written in Java for Windows.  
Basic Information will be in this README. For more specific questions or discussions, join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/4a82kzPX3j) 

## Features
Working Graphical User Interface for easy Setup  
Stream Audio from various Sources  
Inspect Discord User Profiles  
Create a rules embed for new Members


## Setup
First Start might be a bit buggy. Go to "Settings -> Set Token" and paste your Bot Token there, then go to "Settings -> Set Activity" and paste your Bot Activity in there. Lastly, go to "Settings -> Set Command Prefix" and set something like "s!" as your Bots Command Prefix.
Now restart the Bot with "SpookBot -> Restart" and the Bot should all be setup.
